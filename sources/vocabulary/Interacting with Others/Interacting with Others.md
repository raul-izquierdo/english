<!-- TODO: üìÖ /**/ prize vs award -->
Main Differences:
- A prize is generally something won in a competition and is often tangible.
- An award is usually something given for recognition or excellence, often by a judging body, and the honour is the primary focus, even if a tangible item is also presented.

You can often hear them used interchangeably, especially when an award is a prize (e.g., "The Nobel Prize" is both a prize and an award for scientific achievement). However, the distinction lies in the primary emphasis ‚Äì competition vs. recognition of merit.
