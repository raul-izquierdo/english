# Collations

<!-- TODO: 📅 /**/ ¿Esto debería estar aquí o disperso? Es que al repasar, el titulo te dice el verbo a utilizar!!! -->


Collocations in English are natural combinations of words that native speakers tend to use together. They sound "right" to a native ear, even if the meaning is understandable with other words

Examples:
- **make a mistake** (NOT "do a mistake")
- **heavy rain** (NOT "strong rain")
- **fast food** (NOT "quick food")
